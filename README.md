# HTML-Video-Tag-Extractor-and-Updater
This repository contains a Python script that simplifies the process of embedding videos into HTML files by automating the extraction and updating tasks. It allows users to fetch video tags (specifically &lt;iframe>, &lt;object>, and &lt;video>) from the HTML content of a website and update HTML files with selected video tags.
